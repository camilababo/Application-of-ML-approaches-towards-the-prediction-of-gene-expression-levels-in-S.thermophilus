***"promoter_prediction_pipeline.ipnyb"***: Jupyter notebook containing the Machine Learning pipeline for the prediction of gene expression values from promoter sequences. The code and functions related to hierarchical clustering, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), testing the model's performance on the number of features and SHAP importances was provided by Chr. Hansen; <br/>
