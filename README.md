# Prediction_of_gene_expression_levels_in_Streptococcus_thermophilus

The main goal of this project is to construct a workflow for the prediction of gene expression levels in Stretococcus thermophilus from promoter sequences. 
The chosen approach for this was the Machine Learning algorithm Gradient Tree Boosting.
The Gradient Tree Boosting method builds an additive model that allows the ptimization of loss functions. 
Additionaly, we used the open-source machine learning library Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) designed to improve the implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm.
