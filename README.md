# Application of machine learning approaches towards the prediction of gene expression levels in Streptococcus thermophilus

This project was developed with the intention of practicing the implementation of computational tools and the consolidation of the knowledge built in curricular units integrated in the Master's Degree of Bioinformatics in the University of Minho under orientation from Martin Rau with affiliation from Discovery, Chr. Hansen A/S, HÃ¸rsholm, Denmark.

The main goal of this project is to construct a workflow for the prediction of gene expression levels in *Stretococcus thermophilus* from promoter sequences. 
The chosen approach for this was the Machine Learning algorithm Gradient Tree Boosting.
The Gradient Tree Boosting method builds an additive model that allows the optimization of loss functions. 
Additionaly, we used the open-source machine learning library Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) designed to improve the implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm.

The dataset used was extracted from an original article (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00445/full) and the full genome files from the corresponding *Streptococcus thermophilus* strain (ASCC 1275) were downloaded from the NCBI database (Acession Number: CP006819.1).
